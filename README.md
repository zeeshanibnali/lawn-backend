# Lawn Backend

Steps to run the backend server:

1. Run `yarn` command to install the packages
2. Run `yarn start` command

Note: Due to the usage of SQL Lite Database, no database configuration is required.

The server should be listening at PORT 4000 and should be handeling requests from the Lawn app.
